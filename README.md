# GCP Associated Cloud Engineer challenges

This repository contains my implementation of some of the GCP ACE course that you can find in A Cloud Guru.

I decided to create this Terraform implementations since I have been using it for about a year now, and wanted to keep on practicing my skill with the Challenges in the course.

Each folder is intended to be a challenge and each one is deployed by using Terraform Cloud and its mono-repo support.
